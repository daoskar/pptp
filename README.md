# PPTP VPN Server Installer For Debian

This script will let you setup your own PPTP VPN server in no more than a minute. It has been designed to be as universal as possible.

# Installation

Run the script and follow the assistant:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tankibaj/pptp/master/pptp.sh && bash pptp.sh`

Once it ends, you can run it again to add more users or uninstall PPTP.

`bash pptp.sh`

#### Note: This shell should work on ubuntu as well. I haven't tried. Im not big fan of ubuntu
